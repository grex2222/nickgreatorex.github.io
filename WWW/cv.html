		<p> Growing up, I've always had an interest in sports. This being said I played sports early in my life which strated to be competitve when I was
		in Elementary School. This being said I started to take things more seriously when I played sports in Middle School. I got recruted by a basketball AAU Team
		in Maine called MBNation. Basketball was one of the three sports I played. I also played baseball and football throughout my years as well. Baseball and football
		where also a very fun sport for me to play. I played through out Middle School and played on Varisty teams throughout my Highschool years. My passion for sports
		still carries on into college. As I don't play as many sports in college I try to play as much as I can. Intermural sports are the only ones I play in college
		but it doesn't bother me because of the love I have to sports
