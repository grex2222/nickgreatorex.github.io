		<p>Music is my favorite hobby that I have. I spend a lot of my time finding and listening to music. When I can I try my hardest to show
		people the music that they have never heard before. The one thing that I wish I could do would be to become a music major and make or
		produce my own beat. I know that's a stretch but my passion for music should not be underestimated. A lot of my free time can go to music
		and when I'm laying in bed before going to sleep I usually search and research new music. My music taste is very well ranged in the way
		that I listen to a bunch of different types of music, except for country, not a huge fan. My favorite kind of music is Hip-Hop and Rap. I've
		always liked that type of music since I was young. Music is a big passion for me and I refuse to give up on that passion.
