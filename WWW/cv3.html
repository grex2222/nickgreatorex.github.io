		<p>I am very blessed to have the family that I have right now. My mother is a very unique women in the sense that she is somewhat of the typical
		mother but in her own way different. Very hard to explain. My father on the other hand is a very quite and low back kind of dude. 
		him and I have a lot of simularities and sports is a big part of that. My sister and I didn't really get along great when we were younger, but now 
		that I've been away at college we have actually gotten closer. As it comes to my dogs, they are my best friends. I love them and the best thing
		about dogs is they have unconditional love.
