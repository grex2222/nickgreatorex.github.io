		<h2> School </h2>
		
		<p> Growing up in Gorham, Maine, I attended the public schools that they provided. This included Village Elementary School, Gorham Middle School,
		and Gorham High School. All though I was on the fense about going to a private High School in Portland call Cheverus, I neve pulled the trigger
		on going there. After graduating from High School I decided to come to the University of Maine <a href="https://umaine.edu"> </a>. When I started here
		I declaired to be a Civil Engineer. After a year and a half of being a Civil Engineer I decided I didn't want to be that anymore and decided to
		switch to KPE with a minor in business. This really sparked my interest more so than the Civil Engineering. I feel like I made the best choice for
		myself by doing this. Getting an education is the most important thing you can get, and coming to the University of Maine was the best decision I
		could have done.
